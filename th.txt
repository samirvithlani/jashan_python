python :
programming lang / scripting lang
c,cpp,java
python js 

statically | dynamically

1)statically : we have to provide data type to variable... ,c,cpp,
2)dynamically : we dont need to provide: python ,js

x =100 int , p = 90.90 float

intro python:
find: whome:

python : scripts,games,desktop application, web application [dajngo,fastapi],datascience
file --> .py

indendations : {} block..


data types in python 
int
float
str : '' || ""
NoneType



type casting:

implicit type casting: compiler
    int x = 100.20
    print(100)


explicit type casting: programmer

str --> int -->explicit 
int type : int data 

narrow type | broad type

narrow --> float --> int
broad --> int --> float

operators: operators are the sp symbol which can use to perform operatrions bw operands
binery op : min 2 operands
ternenry op : required min 3 operands , ? :
unery op: required only one operands : ++ , --, a++ , --a

arithmetic operators: + , - , /, *,% , **,// floor op
logical op : and or not
relational operaotr : , == , <=,>=,!= ...
asignment operators : =, +=,-=,*=...
membership operaotrs = in  not in
identity operators = is is not
bitwise : <<,>>,<,>^,|,&


decision making statements:
if else
switch case : match case
loops


if condition:
    indentation part
    ifpart...
else:
    else part..    

ladder if else


monthly sal --> year pa --->

if yearly package > 10,000,000 --> 10% loan
if yealr package >  700000 --> 8 %
5000000 -> 6%

no loan



loops:
entery control loop , for while
no * exit control loop : do while

for sp -> ep 

while -> ep

for(int i=1;i<=10;i++)

stirng: to store single or mul char python provides string datatype

array: array is group of similar kind of element:
array static:

python ds:
list
tuple
set
dict

list:
characteristics:
1) list is ordered collection of elements eg:[10,20,30]
2) list is mutable
3) list is heterogeneous : [10,false,10.20,"hello"]
4) list is dynamic in nature: [10,20,30] ->add 100: [10,20,30,100] grow --> remove 20 [10,30,100] -> shrink
5) list is indexed collection of elements: [10,20,30] -> 0,1,2
6) list is iterable collection of elements: [10,20,30] -> for i in list: print(i)
7)list is subscriptable collection of elements: [10,20,30] -> [0:2] -> [10,20]
8)data type of list is list
9) datastructure of list is dynamic array




list:
numbers:
even no list
odd no list
2) sales 7 days : new list : profit 20%
3) list string: len >5 -->
4)remove duplicate elemt from list



tuple:
characteristics:
1) tuple is ordered collection of elements eg:(10,20,30)
2) tuple is immutable
3) tuple is heterogeneous : (10,false,10.20,"hello")
5) tuple is indexed collection of elements: (10,20,30) -> 0,1,2



records = [("Alice", "Math", 80), ("Alice", "Science", 90),
           ("Bob", "Math", 70), ("Bob", "Science", 60)]

[("Alice", 85.0), ("Bob", 65.0)]

task 2
list1 = [1, 2]
list2 = [3, 4]
[(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)]

task3:
students = [(101, "Alice"), (102, "Bob"), (101, "Alice Duplicate")]
output
[101]


list task:

get name from user and add it to list if user insert exit insted of name
then exit and priont list

sales = [100,200,300,400,500,600]
add 10% profit in sales and give new list with profit


remove duplicate element from list
["jay","raj","parth","jay","parth","kunal"]


dict:
dict stores data in key value pair
dict allows duplicate values but not key
dict is hetrog,
dict is mutabledict is subscriptable
dict is iterable


set
set is iterable
but set is not subscriptable
set stores data in hashtable not indexed
set does not allow duplicate elements
set is dynamic
set is hetrogenius
data type of set is set
we can decalre empty set using set({})
set is unordered


function:
def keyword
def funname(param):
   block
   return


4 type of function
